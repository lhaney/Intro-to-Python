# Intro-to-Python

This repository is for the 2017-2018 Intro to Python Programming course (Mods 5-6). In all of the code posted here, error handling should be considered, and code should be properly commented.

Challenges included:
- Bank program: the program should ask the user what they want to do, and either withdraw money from or deposit money to an account with a given starting balance. This assignment tested students' understanding of control flow (IF, WHILE, and FOR loops), print statements, data types, and input commands.

- Classrooms Code: When should students eat in the classrooms? This code should interact with a user, and return instructions for eating in classrooms at Sequoyah based on the user's answers to a series of questions. This assignment tested students understanding of print statements, input commands, and IF loops.

- Test Scoring: Students are asked to write an efficient code that can average the scores of three students over three tests. The program should then output the average test score for each student. If a student scores below a certain score on a test, the output should also tell the student which test they should re-do. This assignment gives students practice defining and calling functions, applying nested loops, and writing efficient code.
